## Principles, in brief:
- Networked communication is a collective good operation of that network should be participatory
- Smartphones are supercomputers. We're treating them like thin clients
- the internet and the web must support people communicating without access to a faraway backbone -- this was one of the core design principles that drove creation of the internet
- If you rely on data you should be able to possess a copy of it
- Reach assertion: If someone holds data about you, you should be able to know and should be able to claim a copy of it [this assertion is actually meaningless in a centralized internet]
- When 2+ people have communication devices that are capable




## Restoring Social Interaction and Social Institutions

- Hijacking attention: our brains are wired to seek social connection. There's nothing inherently wrong with using technology to facilitate and even mediate our social interactions, but this becomes deeply harmful -- both psychologically and socially -- when we allow those interactions to be mediated by corporations and algorithms whose aim is to sell our attention.

Our brains are easy to hijack. We have deeply a ingrained drive to seek social connection and information. This drive, which is fundamentally healthy, leads us to open apps like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tinder, or Grindr. Like flies to a venus flytrap, we find something sweet but really we've been captured. Even before the apps load, our brains start acting like the brains of addicts [CITATION]. We swipe up, swipe down, swipe left, swipe right, seeking information, love, comfort, humor, and expressing our wishes but our brains are acting like gamblers at a slot machine. The algorithms that decide which information to show us are optimized to keep us engaged. They are not optimized for maximum connectedness or genuine satisfaction. They are not designed to leave us thoroughly well informed or broadly engaged in social discourse. They are designed to keep us compulsively engaged. That's what an advertising-based companies like Facebook, Google or any of the others are obligated to do; designing for other outcomes must always be secondary to their primary profit motive: keeping you engaged so they can sell your attention.

Our failure to acknowledge this has eroded our psychological health [CITATION: depression rates, etc] and our social infrastructure, threatening the underpinnings of public discourse, democracy, and scientific discourse.

We must remedy this by changing the way we exchange information. We must remove the middle man. There is still a huge role for companies like Facebook and Google to filter, suggest, and enrich the data we consume, but we must break the pattern of allowing them to be the intermediaries between us and the world around us. The way we break this pattern is by changing _who has possession of the data_ ...

## Resilience: Making a Library that can't burn

holding a copy of the data you rely on, or the data you value

matrix of risk and value

Story: Data Rescue
- location-addressed infrastructure working at odds with the _intention_ of the data rescuers. Making copies == Creating Competition

Solution:
1. Content-addressing
2. Peer to Peer replication/Sharing
3. Coordination (pin sets, Allow lists and Deny lists)

## Offline-First:

My ability to communicate with the people around me should not be limited by my connectivity to the internet's backbone or my connectivity to a faraway server.
- sharing social data _is_ communication. sharing a photo is communication, editing a document is communication

Background: Interplanetary...

## Meeting the Demands of VR, Machine Learning and Internet of Things

Routing all these data through centralized systems simply doesn't make sense.

## "Web Scale" implies Participation

Original notion of web scale meant ... (participation by many, the participants are the infrastructure, which automatically scales with participation increasing/decreasing, CANT be centrally planned or controlled -- permissionless innovation...)

this idea has become lost, with web scale becoming an architectural strategy used _within_ centrally controlled "clouds" run by entities like Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc. "Web Scale" became a term for describing a particular approach to configuring datacenters, and a term for describing the design sensibilities baked into the applications and services that we run in those dataceters.  ... "Web-oriented architectures allow developers to build very flexible and resilient systems that recover from failure more quickly." [gartner]

## Resisting Monopolies

### Resisting Data Monopolies
Example: Microsoft Word Documents vs. Facebook Posts

Story: My Personal Conundrum -- Any Platform that successfully gets people to create value is faced with the _financial obligation_ to exploit that value. Over a long trajectory, good intentions are irrelevant.

### Resisting Monopolistic Control of Connectivity

## Security & Privacy
- Feudal Security
  - Employees at those companies abuse their access (Uber, Facebook, etc)
  - Data breaches occur anyway, often kept secret: Equifax, Experian, Uber, etc.
- Strange behavior: distrusting government surveillance while trusting your privacy to corporations whose expressed purpose is to sell your attention. Apps on smartphones, and code injected into websites, are leaking personal data on a massive scale daily. This arrangement will persist until/unless users claim control over the possession of their data because the operators of those websites and apps are making money off that data.

If we shift to emphasizing a decentralized approach to data storage & data security, it will force us to pay attention to those leaks, which sheds a more nuanced light on the difference between centralized and decentralized approaches to data security.


## Protecting Civilian Infrastructure from Cyber Warfare

In [??? date] Bruce Schneier talked about state actors building electronic arsenals that would allow them to attack civilian infrastructure, crippling the economy and social services that their enemies rely on.

In 2016 we saw two examples of this: DDoS attach on the DNS system and wannacry. In both cases, attackers took down people's ability to access the information they rely on, with substantial economic rammifications.

The case of wannacry's impact on the NHS in England gives us a strong example of centralization failing people. Wannacry prevented hospitals from accessing patients' health records, effectively holding that information hostage. This invites the question: why don't patients have copies of their own health records? Likewise, if my bank's servers were attacked I would not have a verifiable copy of my account ledger. It's technically feasible for us to change this, allowing everyone to securely hold verifiable copies of health records, financial info, etc, so why are we relying on centralized points of failure? Does this make us vulnerable in ways that could be prevented?

This isn't a simple fix: decentralization broadens the potential vectors of attack, for better and for worse. It forces a shift from the feudal approach to data security to participatory approach. TODO
