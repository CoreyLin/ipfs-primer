# Lesson: Making sure that a file persists in your IPFS Repository

## Goals

This lesson covers the topic of "pinning" files in your IPFS repository and removing files with the ipfs garbage collector. Pinning is a very important concept in IPFS. Pinning is the mechanism that allows you to tell IPFS to always keep a given object local.

After doing this Lesson you will be able to
* Tell IPFS to hold onto specific files in your local IPFS repository
* Tell IPFS to clean up unwanted files from your local IPS repository

## Steps

### Step 1: Create the file you're going to add and pin

Create a file called `foo.txt` and put the text "ipfs rocks" in it. Here is an easy way to do this on the command line:

```sh
$ echo "ipfs rocks" > foo.txt
```

### Step 2: Add the file to IPFS

```sh
$ ipfs add foo.txt
added QmRTV3h1jLcACW4FRfdisokkQAk4E4qDhUzGpgdrd4JAFy foo.txt
```

### Step 3: List objects pinned to local storage

```sh
$ ipfs pin ls --type=all
QmRTV3h1jLcACW4FRfdisokkQAk4E4qDhUzGpgdrd4JAFy recursive
QmY5heUM5qgRubMDD1og9fhCPA6QdkMp3QCwd4s7gJsyE7 indirect
```

The first object listed above is the `foo.txt` file. Objects added through `ipfs add` are pinned recursively by default.

There are three types of pins in the ipfs world:

a) direct pins, which pin just a single block, and no others in relation to it;

b) recursive pins, which pin a given block and all of its children;

c) indirect pins, which are the result of a given block's parent being pinned recursively.

### Step 4: Unpin an object

You can unpin `foo.txt` like this:

```sh
$ ipfs pin rm QmRTV3h1jLcACW4FRfdisokkQAk4E4qDhUzGpgdrd4JAFy
unpinned QmRTV3h1jLcACW4FRfdisokkQAk4E4qDhUzGpgdrd4JAFy
```

Ok, now verify that it no longer exists:

```sh
$ ipfs cat QmRTV3h1jLcACW4FRfdisokkQAk4E4qDhUzGpgdrd4JAFy
ipfs rocks
```

Wait, it still appears to be there! Ok, you must run the garbage collector and then verify again:

```sh
$ ipfs repo gc
removed QmRTV3h1jLcACW4FRfdisokkQAk4E4qDhUzGpgdrd4JAFy
$ ipfs cat QmRTV3h1jLcACW4FRfdisokkQAk4E4qDhUzGpgdrd4JAFy
Error: merkledag: not found
```

IPFS has a fairly aggressive caching mechanism that will keep an object local for a short time after you perform any ipfs operation on it, but these objects may get garbage collected fairly regularly.

A pinned object cannot be garbage collected, if you don't believe me try this:

```sh
$ ipfs add foo.txt
added QmRTV3h1jLcACW4FRfdisokkQAk4E4qDhUzGpgdrd4JAFy foo.txt
$ ipfs repo gc
$ ipfs cat QmRTV3h1jLcACW4FRfdisokkQAk4E4qDhUzGpgdrd4JAFy
ipfs rocks
```

## Explanation

IPFS nodes treat the data they store like a cache, meaning that there is no guarantee that the data will continue to be stored. Pinning a CID (hash) tells an IPFS node that the data is important and mustnâ€™t be thrown away. You should pin any content you consider important, to ensure that content is retained long-term. Since data important to someone else may not be important to you, pinning lets you have control over the disk space and data retention you need.
