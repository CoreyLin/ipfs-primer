# DWeb Primer

## Why decentralize
- Data Together, possession
- p2p scalability

## Isn't the Web already Decentralized?
- who gets to be peers?
- who possesses the information? who is even capable of possessing the data?
- [The web as it works right now is naturally centralised, for a simple reason: the bandwidth costs on a server is proportional to the size of its audience. This is why we need YouTube to begin with, instead of millions of people posting their videos on their personal page.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15888616)

## How to make a decentralized web?
- [If you want a truly decentralised web, you need to modify a couple things: get rid of HTTP, and use a P2P protocol instead. Generalise IPv6 and get rid of NAT. Give people symmetric bandwidth. Make secure software that is simple to implement, simple to use, and hard to misuse (it's not that hard dammit, just look at qmail).](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15888616)

## Controlling access and deleting information

## Cryptocurrencies, Incentives and Token-incentivised Networks


## The upgrade path
Search/Discovery
Advertising-based business models won't go away.

## The Technology
- In brief: immutable + authenticated data structures, p2p connectivity, and interoperable data formats
- Merkle Trees
- Peer to Peer networking
- Unix FS as data format
- Routing
- Overlay Networks
- Making it work in browsers
- Future-proofing (ie. Multihash)

# Is it safe?
- [If competent ultra techno geeks can get hacked, the problem looks to be unsolvable for the general homeowner to safely run a p2p server.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15890914)
- Feudal security (Schneier)
- Gigantic data leaks by centralized parties (Equifax, Experian, etc)
