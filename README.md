# The Decentralized Web Primer

This primer contains a series of tutorials explaining IPFS, Merkle Trees and the Decentralized Web. It's written and maintained as a [gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/about) so people can read it in many formats.

When this is finished, this primer will be a complete replacement for the examples at https://ipfs.io/docs/examples/

## Topics

The primer contains Tutorials about
* [Files on IPFS](files-on-ipfs/README.md)
* [Merkle Trees and the IPFS DAG](ipfs-dag/README.md)
* [Dynamic Content on IPFS](/dynamic-content/README.md)

## Concepts

* Cryptographic Hashes and Content Addressability
* Authenticated Graphs
* Turning Files into Trees
* Turning any Data into Trees
* Publishing hashes on the DHT
* Getting data from the Peer to Peer Network
* Immutability: "Changes" as _additions_ to the tree
* CRDTs
* Pubsub
* Authenticated Streams (with pubsub)

## Format

The primer is a collection of tutorials, or lessons, that all use a format inspired by the [Railsbridge Curriculum](http://curriculum.railsbridge.org/intro-to-rails/). Each tutorial declares a set of *Goals*, or [learning objectives](http://edglossary.org/learning-objectives/), then lists the *Steps*, or activities, and finally provides an *Explanation* that reviews what you've done and connects those activities to the tutorial's stated Goals. The format for each tutorial looks like this:

## Note for Contributors

For a concise explanation of Learning Objectives (which we're calling _Goals_ in this book), read UC Denver's [Assessment & Instructional Alignment Tutorial](http://www.ucdenver.edu/faculty_staff/faculty/center-for-faculty-development/Documents/Tutorials/Assessment/module3/index.htm). Try to make your learning objectives [Specific, observable and measurable](http://www.ucdenver.edu/faculty_staff/faculty/center-for-faculty-development/Documents/Tutorials/Assessment/module3/good_objectives.htm) and heed their tip to use the list of verbs in the [taxonomy table worksheet](http://www.ucdenver.edu/faculty_staff/faculty/center-for-faculty-development/Documents/Tutorials/Assessment/documents/examples_verbs_cognitive_process_level.pdf) to help you choose observable behaviors for your course learning objectives.
