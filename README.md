# Introduction: Networks + Incentives

This primer is about wielding networks and incentives. If you don't know what I mean by that, don't worry.

What are Networks?

- Telephone networks
- Your brain is a network
- The global economy is a network
- Spy networks...

The power of networks
- Exponential power...

- Overlay Networks
  - Example: VoIP over copper-wire phone network (which was created to carry voice calls)

What are Incentives?



* [I love you. I want you to be happy and I want you to have the causes of happiness.]
* Communities and Individuals should have the power to control what is stored on their machines and transmitted on their networks
* People who rely on information should be able to possess a copy of it (collectively or individually)
    * Parallels to open source and open access principles

The biggest problem we face right now: believing that interaction with mediated data is a form of social connection
* Decentralization doesnâ€™t solve this, but a whole category of viable solutions depend on decentralized technology

Online storage & dissemination as Cultural voice, Traditional Knowledge vs Captive Social Data
* Possibly make this a separate essay specific to the Foundation?
* Impossiblility of Unbiased search [Bourg & Sadler]

Data structures & the Evolution of Language
*  vocabularies that allowed convergent behavior (for better or worse)
    * English
    * Creative Commons
    * TK (Traditional Knowledge)
    * Dublin Core, LCSH, MESH
* data structures that allowed convergent behavior
    * Word Processor Documents, Spreadsheets
