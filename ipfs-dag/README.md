# Tutorial: Merkle Trees and the IPFS DAG

## Concepts
These Lessons introduce the following concepts:
* Cryptographic Hashes and Content Addressability
* Authenticated Graphs
* Turning Files into Trees
* Turning any Data into Trees
* Publishing hashes on the DHT
* Getting data from the Peer to Peer Network
